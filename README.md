# NWLON_WebCOOS_Synchronizer

Create time-synchronized visualizations of [NOAA CO-OPS water level data](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/inundationdb/) and [WebCOOS webcamera imagery](https://webcoos.org/) or your own time-stamped imagery, including from pan-tilt-zoom (PTZ) cameras.

## Installation

For general use:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/NOAA-CO-OPS/NWLON_WebCOOS_Synchronizer.git#egg=nwlon_webcoos_synchronizer
```

For development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NOAA-CO-OPS/NWLON_WebCOOS_Synchronizer.git
cd NWLON_WebCOOS_Synchronizer
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate nwlon_webcoos_synchronizer
```


## WebCOOS API Key

To use the tool with WebCOOS imagery or run the test suite, you need a WebCOOS API Key. You can register for one [here](https://webcoos.org/docs/doc/access/)



## Test

Unit and integration tests are included. 

To run the tests, follow the "For development" installation instructions. Then, set your WebCOOS API key as an environment variable (replace 'your_key' with your actual WebCOOS API key, in single quotes):

Linux:
```bash
export API_KEY='your_key'
```

Windows:
```bash
setx API_KEY 'your_key'
```

Then you can run the tests with:

```bash
pytest -v
```


## Usage

For WebCOOS imagery:

```python
import nwlon_webcoos_synchronizer as nws
token = ''  # Insert your WebCOOS API token here #
station = 8665530
camera = 'North Inlet-Winyah Bay  National Estuarine Research Reserve Dock, Georgetown, SC'
synchro = nws.synch(station=station,                     # The NWLON station ID
                    camera=camera,                       # The WebCOOS camera name #
                    data_product='water_level',          # The CO-OPS data product to make a timeseries of #
                    camera_product='one-minute-stills',  # The WebCOOS image product to use for the movie #
                    value='all',                         # Can be 'all' or a float value, depending on what you want.
                    time_start='202312170800',           # Start of the movie in local time at the camera location #
                    time_end='202312171000',             # End of the movie in local time at the camera location
                    interval=6,                          # Interval of data and imagery, in minutes. #
                    cutoff=None,                         # Make the movie of only this many data points. Use with value to get what you want.  #
                    sep_model=None,                      # A trained view separation model. Can be made yourself. Not needed for this non-PTZ camera.
                    token=token,                         # Your WebCOOS API Token
                    save_dir='.')                        # The directory in which to save the images and movie
mov = synch.make_movie(synchro,camera,station)
```

For your own imagery:

```python
import nwlon_webcoos_synchronizer as nws
station = 8774230
camera = 'My camera with any name'
synchro = nws.synch_local(station=station, 
                          camera=camera, 
                          data_product='water_level', 
                          local_dir='/dir_with_time_stamped_imagery', 
                          value='all', 
                          time_start='yyyymmddHHMM', 
                          time_end='yyyymmddHHMM', 
                          interval=6, 
                          cutoff=None)
mov = synch.make_movie(synchro,camera,station)
```
